A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Push 5 solutions every week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript

First thing I do everyday is to solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code for efficiency and readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

The main lesson I learned while solving this enormous supply of questions is to remain consistent. Not being able to answer a question or getting it right everytime is okay, as long as you remain consistent and try to improve everyday.
